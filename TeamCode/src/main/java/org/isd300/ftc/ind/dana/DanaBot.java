/*

        Big ideas:
            * java is object oriented
            * a class represents an object
            * packages organize files hierarchically
            * variables can be class-scoped or method scoped.
            * variables can be declared only once within a scope
            * methods are actions. They may change variables; they may change behavior.
            *   They can organize a program so that it's easier to understand.
